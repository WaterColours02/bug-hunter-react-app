# bug-hunter-react-app

This is a basic CRUD app built with REACT and Javascript. I'm using it as a portfolio project to demonstrate my knowledge of react and javascript. 

To spin up the application clone the repository. 
Once the repository is cloned, open your console you will need to add the .env file to the root. 
I will send that to you on request. I'm using the .env to kepe my firebase API key off of github. 

once you ahve added the .env file to the root. 

open terminal and navigate tot he root and run the commands below. 

"npm install" 
"npm start" 

application should open through localhost:/3000


At the momment the app has some a bug when using the "edit issue" function. 
When you press the "update" button in the edit modal, firebase is update but it throws an error and React fails to re-render.... 
I'm not sure why this is happening because it was previously working. 

Thanks for ehcking out my work. 

BEST,
_HUNTER
