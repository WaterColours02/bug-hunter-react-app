# bug-hunter-react-app

This is a basic CRUD app built with REACT and Javascript. I'm using it as a portfolio project to demonstrate my knowledge of react and javascript. 

To spin up the application clone the repository. 
Once the repository is cloned, open your console / terminal and navigate to the "bug-hunter-react-app" directory 

Run these commands:

"npm install" 
"npm start" 

and the application should open. 


At the momment the app has some a bug when using the "edit issue" function. 
When you press the "update" button in the edit modal, firebase is update but it throws an error and React fails to re-render.... 
I'm not sure why this is happening because it was previously working. 

Thanks for ehcking out my work. 

BEST,
_HUNTER
