# bug-hunter-react-app

This is a basic CRUD app built with REACT and Javascript. I'm using it as a portfolio project to demonstrate my knowledge of react and javascript. 

To spin up the application clone the repository. 
Once the repository is cloned, open your console / terminal and navigate to the "bug-hunter-react-app" directory 

Run these commands:

"npm install" 
"npm start" 

and the application should open. 




At the momment I think i have most of the functionality working. The css styling goes a little funky when you input longer descriptions in the the input field and submit them. 
that is an easy fix and something i will address before i upload this to my portfolio. 

The one issue I ahve encountered is that when you use the search field and then delete and issue the reach app component doesn't re-render (doesn't show) the card being deleted until you change the value in the search field. 
I'm not sure how to fix this. 


Thanks for checking out my work. 

BEST,
_HUNTER
